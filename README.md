# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Project Name: PetsPaw

# Purpose:

This project is created to facilitate the search for cat breeds and provide a brief overview of a particular breed, including temperament, adult weight, lifespan, and a short description. The functionality is presented through three main routes. Additionally, a slider is integrated for convenient photo viewing, and there is an option to display additional images. Using sorting buttons, users can sort breeds alphabetically. This functionality is presented under the "BREEDS" route. Under the "Voting" route, users can express their reactions to images. All user reactions can be viewed in components that open when clicking on emoji buttons. The "Gallery" route allows users to see a form where they can input specific values and receive corresponding results, such as static photos, gif images, and a separate view of cat breeds of interest. If users want to share their photos, they can do so using the upload button in the Gallery component, which opens a modal window for photo upload. The project also features a search function for finding cats by name.Adaptation for mobile version and tablet was added to this project
